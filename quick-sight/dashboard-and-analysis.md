# QuickSight - Dashboard & Analysis

Amazon QuickSight allows you to define users and groups, create dashboards, and perform analyses. Note that users and groups in QuickSight are distinct from IAM users and groups.

## Users and Groups

- **Users**: Standard version users exist only within QuickSight.
- **Groups**: Available in the Enterprise edition, groups also exist only within QuickSight.

## Dashboard

- **Read-Only Snapshot**: A dashboard is a read-only snapshot of an analysis that you can share.
- **Configuration Preservation**: It preserves the configuration of the analysis, including filtering, parameters, controls, and sorting.

## Sharing

- **Share with Users or Groups**: You can share both analyses and dashboards with QuickSight users or groups.
- **Publish First**: To share a dashboard, you must first publish it.
- **Data Visibility**: Users who view the dashboard can also see the underlying data.
