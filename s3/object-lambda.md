# S3 Object Lambda

S3 Object Lambda allows you to use AWS Lambda functions to modify and process data as it is retrieved from S3, before delivering it to the end user. This enables dynamic data transformation and processing without altering the original data stored in S3.

## Architecture

1. **S3 Bucket**: The primary storage location for your objects.
2. **S3 Access Point**: A configuration layer that simplifies managing data access at scale for applications using shared data sets on S3.
3. **S3 Object Lambda Access Point**: An extension of S3 Access Points that integrates with AWS Lambda to process data as it is retrieved.

## Use Cases

- **Data Redaction**: Automatically redact personally identifiable information (PII) from files when accessed for analytics or in non-production environments.
- **Format Conversion**: Convert data from one format to another, such as XML to JSON, on the fly as it is requested.
- **Image Processing**: Resize and watermark images dynamically based on caller-specific details, such as the identity of the user requesting the object.

## Steps to Implement

1. **Create an AWS Lambda Function**: Write a Lambda function to perform the desired transformation, such as redaction, format conversion, or image processing.
2. **Set Up an S3 Access Point**: Create an S3 Access Point for the bucket where your objects are stored.
3. **Create an S3 Object Lambda Access Point**: Link your Lambda function to the S3 Access Point. This enables the Lambda function to process data as it is retrieved through the Object Lambda Access Point.
4. **Retrieve Data**: Access your data through the S3 Object Lambda Access Point. AWS Lambda will process the data according to your function before returning it to the caller.

By leveraging S3 Object Lambda, you can perform complex data transformations and processing in real-time, ensuring that your applications always receive the data in the exact format they need.
