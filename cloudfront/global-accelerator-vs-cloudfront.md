# Global Accelerator vs CloudFront

Amazon Web Services offers both Global Accelerator and CloudFront to leverage its global network and edge locations for improved application performance. While they share some similarities, such as integration with AWS Shield for DDoS protection, they serve different purposes and are optimized for different types of content and applications.

## Similarities

- **AWS Global Network**: Both services utilize the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world to reduce latency.
- **DDoS Protection**: Integration with AWS Shield provides DDoS protection, enhancing the security posture of applications.

## CloudFront

- **Content Delivery**: Optimized for delivering both cacheable content (e.g., images, videos) and dynamic content (e.g., API acceleration, dynamic site delivery) efficiently.
- **Edge Serving**: Content is served from the edge, closer to the users, to improve performance and reduce latency.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for web applications requiring fast delivery of static and dynamic content.

## Global Accelerator

- **Application Acceleration**: Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
- **Non-HTTP Use Cases**: A good fit for applications that use non-HTTP protocols, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP.
- **Static IP Addresses**: Provides static IP addresses that are a good fit for HTTP use cases requiring consistent IP addresses for whitelisting or regulatory reasons.
- **Regional Failover**: Offers deterministic, fast regional failover for HTTP use cases, enhancing application availability and reliability.

In summary, CloudFront is best suited for web content delivery, leveraging caching for performance, while Global Accelerator is tailored for applications requiring consistent performance across TCP or UDP, including non-HTTP protocols and scenarios needing static IP addresses or fast regional failover.
