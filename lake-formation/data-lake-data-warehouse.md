# Data Lake vs Data Warehouse

## Data Lake

- **Purpose**: Store vast amounts of raw data in its native format until it is needed.
- **Data Types**: Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- **Schema**: Schema-on-read, meaning the schema is applied when the data is read.
- **Storage Cost**: Generally lower cost due to the use of inexpensive storage solutions.
- **Processing**: Uses big data processing frameworks like Hadoop, Spark.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for data scientists and engineers who need to perform complex analytics, machine learning, and data exploration.

## Data Warehouse

- **Purpose**: Store processed and refined data for quick and efficient querying and reporting.
- **Data Types**: Primarily supports structured data.
- **Schema**: Schema-on-write, meaning the schema is defined before the data is written.
- **Storage Cost**: Generally higher cost due to the use of high-performance storage solutions.
- **Processing**: Uses SQL-based querying and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for business analysts and decision-makers who need to generate reports and perform business intelligence tasks.

## Key Differences

- **Data Structure**: Data lakes store raw data, while data warehouses store processed data.
- **Schema**: Data lakes use schema-on-read, whereas data warehouses use schema-on-write.
- **Cost**: Data lakes are typically more cost-effective for storage, while data warehouses are optimized for performance.
- **Flexibility**: Data lakes offer more flexibility in terms of data types and processing frameworks.
- **Performance**: Data warehouses provide faster query performance for structured data and predefined queries.
