Frequently Asked Questions


Before deploying a web application, we should understand the basic concept of Secure Socket Layers (SSL), what they are, and how to request them for free using Amazon Certificate Manager.

Overview of SSL/TLS Certificates
An SSL certificate is like an ID card or a badge that proves someone is who they say they are. SSL certificates are stored and displayed on the Web by a website’s or application’s server.

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remains private and integral. Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) is a must-have whenever sensitive data is moved to and from a website. For instance, sites that require compliance with requirements such as PCI-DSS, FedRAMP, and HIPAA make extensive use of SSL/TLS. Unfortunately, provisioning and managing SSL/TLS certificates can entail a lot of work that is usually manual and not easily automated.

HTTP vs HTTPS

Are SSL and TLS identical?
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to SSL. TLS is an improved version of SSL. It works in much the same way as SSL, using encryption to protect the transfer of data and information. The two terms are often used interchangeably in the industry, although SSL is still widely used.

Read about: Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). Its overview, features, and types.

How SSL/TLS works
A server attempts to connect to a website (i.e. a web server) secured with SSL. The server requests that the web server identify itself.
The web server sends the server a copy of its SSL certificate.
The server checks to see whether or not it trusts the SSL certificate. If so, it sends a message to the web server.
The web server sends back a digitally signed acknowledgment to start an SSL-encrypted session.
Encrypted data is shared between the server and the web server.

What is AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)? 
AWS Certificate Manager is a service that allows you to easily issue, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for usage with AWS services and internally connected resources. SSL/TLS certificates are used to protect network connections and establish the identity of websites on the Internet as well as resources on private networks. AWS Certificate Manager automates the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates.

Why AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)? 
ACM simplifies the process of enabling SSL/TLS for a website or application on the AWS infrastructure. Many of the manual processes formerly connected with using and managing SSL/TLS certificates are eliminated by ACM. By managing renewals, ACM can also help you minimize downtime caused by misconfigured, revoked, or expired certificates. You receive SSL/TLS security and simple AWS certificate administration. Certificate private keys are safely safeguarded and maintained when you use ACM to handle certificates, thanks to strong encryption and key management best practices. ACM allows you to centrally manage all SSL/TLS ACM certificates in an AWS Region by using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS Certificate Manager APIs.

With AWS Certificate Manager, you will be able to quickly request a certificate, deploy it on ACM-integrated AWS resources, like Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon CloudFront distributions, and APIs on API Gateway, and let AWS Certificate Manager handle certificate renewals.

Use Cases of AWS Certificate Manager ACM
Scenario 1: Secure E-commerce Website
Situation: A business that conducts online sales must secure its website to safeguard client information. To guarantee encrypted communication, they need SSL/TLS certificates.

Solution:

ACM Integration: The business supplies SSL/TLS certificates for its Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) through AWS Certificate Manager.
Result: Sensitive consumer data is protected from hackers with a strong encryption system on the website. By automating certificate renewals, ACM guarantees ongoing security without requiring human participation.
Certificate Manager
Scenario 2: Content Delivery Network (CDN) Security
Situation: A media streaming service has to use its CDN to transmit encrypted data to safely distribute material to a global audience.

Solution:

ACM Integration: To deploy SSL/TLS certificates, the service connects Amazon CloudFront with AWS Certificate Manager.
Result: High transfer speeds and minimal latency are used to safely transport content. By managing certificates, ACM makes sure that every piece of data sent via CloudFront is encrypted.
Demo: Requesting SSL/TLS Certificates Using Certificate Manager in AWS
We will be performing 6 steps to request an SSL/TLS Certificate using AWS Certificate Manager.

Step 1: Provision Certificates
To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the ACM console. Choose Request a certificate.

AWS Certificate Manager ACMStep 2: Request a Certificate
Now, choose Request a certificate to request a new certificate, and click on Next.

AWS Certificate Manager ACMStep 3: Provide Domain Names
Provide your domain name and don’t forget to add a wildcard before your domain name.

Request Public Certificate ACMStep 4: Select the Validation Method
With DNS validation, you add a CNAME record to your DNS configuration to establish control of your domain name. Choose DNS validation and click on Request.
