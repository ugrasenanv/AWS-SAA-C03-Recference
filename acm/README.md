# AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): Simplifying SSL/TLS Certificate Management

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a managed service that simplifies the process of obtaining, managing, and deploying SSL/TLS certificates for AWS services and internal resources. It allows you to easily request certificates, automate renewals, and deploy them to AWS resources like Elastic Load Balancers and Amazon CloudFront distributions. ACM also enables you to create private certificates for internal use and centrally manage your certificate lifecycle.

### Key Features and Benefits:

#### 1. **Simplified Certificate Management**

* ACM handles the complexities of creating, storing, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates, freeing up your time and resources.

#### 2. **Free Public Certificates**

* Public SSL/TLS certificates provisioned through ACM and used with integrated AWS services are free.

#### 3. **Automated Renewal**

* ACM automatically renews certificates before they expire, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous security.

#### 4. **Private Certificate Support**

* ACM allows you to create private certificates using AWS Private Certificate Authority (PCA) for internal applications and services.

#### 5. **Centralized Management**

* ACM provides a central console, CLI, and API for managing certificates, including auditing their use.

#### 6. **Wide Range of Integration**

* ACM integrates with various AWS services, including Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and others.

### What is AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)?

AWS Certificate Manager is a service that allows you to easily issue, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates for usage with AWS services and internally connected resources. SSL/TLS certificates are used to protect network connections and establish the identity of websites on the Internet as well as resources on private networks. AWS Certificate Manager automates the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates.

### Why AWS Certificate Manager?

ACM simplifies the process of enabling SSL/TLS for a website or application on the AWS infrastructure. Many of the manual processes formerly connected with using and managing SSL/TLS certificates are eliminated by ACM. By managing renewals, ACM can also help you minimize downtime caused by misconfigured, revoked, or expired certificates. You receive SSL/TLS security and simple AWS certificate administration. Certificate private keys are safely safeguarded and maintained when you use ACM to handle certificates, thanks to strong encryption and key management best practices. ACM allows you to centrally manage all SSL/TLS ACM certificates in an AWS Region by using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS Certificate Manager APIs.

### Use Cases of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

#### Scenario 1: Secure E-commerce Website

**Situation**: A business that conducts online sales must secure its website to safeguard client information. To guarantee encrypted communication, they need SSL/TLS certificates.

**Solution**:

* **ACM Integration**: The business supplies SSL/TLS certificates for its Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) through AWS Certificate Manager.
* **Result**: Sensitive consumer data is protected from hackers with a strong encryption system on the website. By automating certificate renewals, ACM guarantees ongoing security without requiring human intervention.

---

#### Scenario 2: Content Delivery Network (CDN) Security

**Situation**: A media streaming service has to use its CDN to transmit encrypted data to safely distribute material to a global audience.

**Solution**:

* **ACM Integration**: To deploy SSL/TLS certificates, the service connects Amazon CloudFront with AWS Certificate Manager.
* **Result**: High transfer speeds and minimal latency are used to safely transport content. By managing certificates, ACM ensures that every piece of data sent via CloudFront is encrypted.

### Demo: Requesting SSL/TLS Certificates Using AWS Certificate Manager

We will follow six steps to request an SSL/TLS Certificate using AWS Certificate Manager.

#### **Step 1: Provision Certificates**

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the ACM console. Choose **Request a certificate**.

#### **Step 2: Request a Certificate**

Click on **Request a certificate** to request a new certificate, and then click on **Next**.

#### **Step 3: Provide Domain Names**

Provide your domain name and don’t forget to add a wildcard before your domain name.

#### **Step 4: Select the Validation Method**

With DNS validation, you add a CNAME record to your DNS configuration to establish control over your domain name. Choose **DNS validation** and click on **Request**.

#### **Step 5: Create a Record in Route 53**

Click on **Create a record in Route 53** (Make sure you have already created the Hosted Zone for the Domain name in Route 53).

Click on **Create Records**.

#### **Step 6: Certificate Issued**

Refresh the page, and once the validation is completed, the status of the certificate will be **Issued** (It generally takes 45 minutes to 1 hour for this process to be completed).
