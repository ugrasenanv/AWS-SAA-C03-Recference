# Snowball Usage Process

The process of using AWS Snowball devices for data transfer involves several steps from requesting the device to ensuring the data is securely transferred to AWS. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Request Snowball Devices**: Initiate the process by requesting Snowball devices through the AWS Management Console. Specify the number of devices and the storage capacity needed for your data transfer job.

2. **Install Snowball Client / AWS OpsHub**: Once the devices are received, install the Snowball client or AWS OpsHub on your local servers. These tools are essential for interacting with the Snowball device.

3. **Connect and Copy Files**: Connect the Snowball device to your servers using the provided cables. Use the Snowball client or AWS OpsHub to copy files from your servers to the Snowball device. The client software facilitates the secure transfer of files.

4. **Ship Back the Device**: After transferring all the necessary files to the Snowball device, prepare it for return shipping. The AWS Console provides shipping labels and instructions. The device is designed to ship securely to the correct AWS facility.

5. **Data Loading into S3**: Upon receiving the Snowball device, AWS personnel will load your data into the designated Amazon S3 bucket. You can track the progress of this process through the AWS Management Console.

6. **Device Wiping**: After your data has been successfully transferred to S3, the Snowball device is completely wiped using AWS's secure procedures, ensuring no data is recoverable from the device.

This process ensures a secure, efficient, and cost-effective method for transferring large amounts of data into AWS.
