# FSx for Lustre

Amazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed service that provides cost-effective, high-performance, scalable file storage for high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

## Overview

- **Parallel Distributed File System**: Lustre is designed for large-scale cluster computing, capable of handling large volumes of data across many servers.
- **Origin of Name**: The name "Lustre" combines "Linux" and "cluster", reflecting its design for Linux-based cluster environments.

## Key Use Cases

- **Machine Learning**: Accelerates training and inference processes by providing fast access to large datasets.
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: Supports complex computational tasks such as simulations and modeling at scale.
- **Video Processing**: Enables efficient processing of video content, from editing to rendering.
- **Financial Modeling**: Facilitates rapid analysis and computation for financial simulations and risk assessments.
- **Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**: Supports the demands of EDA workflows, including simulation, verification, and analysis.

## Performance and Scalability

- **High Scalability**: Scales up to hundreds of GB/s, millions of IOPS, and sub-millisecond latencies, meeting the needs of the most demanding workloads.
- **Storage Options**:
    - **SSD Storage**: Optimized for low-latency, IOPS-intensive workloads, particularly effective for small and random file operations.
    - **HDD Storage**: Best suited for throughput-intensive workloads, ideal for large and sequential file operations.

## Integration with Amazon S3

- **Seamless S3 Integration**: FSx for Lustre can directly read from and write to Amazon S3, treating it as an extension of the file system. This allows for easy data movement between FSx for Lustre and S3, facilitating workflows that require processing data stored in S3.

## Accessibility

- **On-Premises Access**: Organizations can access FSx for Lustre from on-premises servers via VPN or AWS Direct Connect, enabling hybrid cloud scenarios and seamless integration with existing infrastructure.
