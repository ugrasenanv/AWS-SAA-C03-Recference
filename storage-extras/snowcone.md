# AWS Snowcone & Snowcone SSD

AWS Snowcone and Snowcone SSD are part of the AWS Snow Family, designed for edge computing, storage, and data transfer in environments where traditional data transfer methods are impractical due to connectivity limitations or physical conditions.

## Key Features

- **Portability**: Both devices are small and lightweight, making them easy to transport. Snowcone weighs 4.5 pounds (2.1 kg), suitable for space-constrained environments.
- **Rugged and Secure**: Engineered to withstand harsh environments, ensuring data integrity and security even in challenging conditions.
- **Edge Computing and Storage**: Provides local computing and storage capabilities, enabling data processing and storage at the edge.

## Differences

### Snowcone

- **Storage**: Equipped with 8TB of HDD storage.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for edge computing and data transfer needs where space is limited and Snowball devices are not feasible.

### Snowcone SSD

- **Storage**: Comes with 14TB of SSD storage, offering faster data access speeds.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for environments requiring high-speed storage and where durability and quick data retrieval are critical.

## Operational Flexibility

- **Power Requirements**: Users must provide their own power source (battery or cables), offering flexibility in deployment across various scenarios.
- **Data Transfer Options**:
    - **Offline**: Devices can be shipped back to AWS for data ingestion.
    - **Online**: Connect the device to the internet and use AWS DataSync for efficient online data transfer.

## Conclusion

AWS Snowcone and Snowcone SSD extend the AWS infrastructure to the edge, providing a robust solution for data collection, processing, and transfer in remote, disconnected, or harsh environments. Their portability, ruggedness, and flexible data transfer options make them an essential tool for edge computing requirements.
