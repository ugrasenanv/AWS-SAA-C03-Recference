# AWS Snowmobile

AWS Snowmobile is an exabyte-scale data transfer service designed to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS. It is a part of the AWS Snow Family, specifically tailored for transferring data volumes that exceed 10 petabytes (PB).

## Key Features

- **Massive Capacity**: Each Snowmobile is equipped with 100PB of storage capacity, allowing for the transfer of up to exabytes of data with multiple Snowmobiles used in parallel.
- **High Security**: Ensures data security through temperature control, GPS tracking, and 24/7 video surveillance during the transport process.
- **Efficiency**: Significantly more efficient for transferring data volumes over 10PB compared to using AWS Snowball devices, reducing the time and complexity involved in large-scale data migrations.

## Use Cases

- **Exabyte-scale Data Transfer**: Ideal for moving datasets of exabyte scale into AWS, such as large-scale media archives, scientific data, or entire data center migrations.
- **High-Security Requirements**: Suitable for organizations with stringent security and compliance requirements, offering peace of mind during the data transfer process.

By leveraging AWS Snowmobile, organizations can efficiently and securely migrate massive volumes of data to AWS, facilitating cloud adoption and data center decommissioning projects.
