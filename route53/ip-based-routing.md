## IP-based Routing

IP-based routing allows you to direct traffic based on the client's IP address. This method involves mapping CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) ranges to specific endpoints or locations, enabling targeted routing decisions that can optimize performance and reduce network costs.

### Key Concepts

- **CIDR Ranges**: Specify groups of IP addresses associated with clients or regions.
- **Endpoints/Locations**: Define the destination for traffic originating from each CIDR range.

### Configuration Steps

1. **List CIDR Ranges and Endpoints**:
    - Compile a list of CIDR ranges and the corresponding endpoints. This list forms the basis of your routing logic.

2. **Determine Client IP Address**:
    - Extract the client's IP address from incoming requests. This typically occurs at the network edge, such as a load balancer.

3. **Match Client IP to CIDR Range**:
    - Compare the client's IP address against your list of CIDR ranges to find an appropriate match.

4. **Route to Endpoint**:
    - Direct the request to the endpoint associated with the matched CIDR range. If no match is found, route to a default endpoint.

5. **Handle Edge Cases**:
    - Implement logic to address scenarios where a client's IP does not match any listed CIDR range, directing these requests to a predetermined default endpoint.

### Use Cases

- **Performance Optimization**: Route users to the nearest or most efficient endpoint based on their IP address, reducing latency.
- **Cost Reduction**: Direct traffic in a way that minimizes bandwidth costs or leverages cost-effective resources.
- **ISP-Specific Routing**: Route users from specific ISPs to designated endpoints to manage load or performance.

### Example

Routing end users from a particular ISP to a specific endpoint can be achieved by identifying the CIDR ranges associated with that ISP and mapping those ranges to the desired endpoint.

### Considerations

- **Accuracy of CIDR Mappings**: Ensure that the CIDR ranges accurately reflect the intended groups of IP addresses.
- **Dynamic IP Addresses**: Be aware that some users may have dynamic IP addresses that could affect routing decisions.
- **Default Routing**: Always define a default routing path for IP addresses that do not match any specified CIDR range.
