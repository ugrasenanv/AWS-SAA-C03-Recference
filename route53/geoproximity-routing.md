## Geoproximity Routing Policy in Route 53

Geoproximity routing in AWS Route 53 allows you to route traffic based on the geographic location of both your users and your resources. Additionally, it provides the capability to adjust the flow of traffic to these resources by defining bias values.

### Key Features

- **Traffic Distribution Based on Location**: Directs user requests to the nearest resources based on geographic location.
- **Bias Values**: Adjust the geographic region size affecting traffic distribution to resources.
    - **Expand Region (Bias: 1 to 99)**: Increases the likelihood of more traffic being routed to the resource.
    - **Shrink Region (Bias: -1 to -99)**: Decreases the likelihood of traffic being routed to the resource.

### Resource Types

- **AWS Resources**: Specify the AWS region where the resource is located.
- **Non-AWS Resources**: Specify the exact latitude and longitude for the resource.

### Using Route 53 Traffic Flow

- To utilize the geoproximity routing policy, you must use Route 53's advanced traffic flow feature. This allows for more sophisticated routing strategies that can be tailored to the specific needs of your application.

### Configuration Steps

1. **Identify Resources**: Determine whether your resources are hosted on AWS or externally. For AWS resources, note the region. For non-AWS resources, obtain the latitude and longitude.

2. **Define Bias Values**:
    - Decide whether to expand or shrink the geographic region for each resource based on your traffic distribution goals.
    - Assign a bias value accordingly (positive to expand, negative to shrink).

3. **Configure in Route 53 Traffic Flow**:
    - Access the Route 53 traffic flow feature.
    - Create a geoproximity routing policy, specifying the resource locations and their corresponding bias values.

### Considerations

- **Strategic Bias Setting**: Use bias values strategically to optimize the user experience by balancing load and reducing latency.
- **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Regularly monitor the performance of your routing policy and adjust bias values as necessary to respond to changes in traffic patterns or resource availability.

By leveraging the geoproximity routing policy with carefully chosen bias values, you can enhance the efficiency of traffic distribution to your resources, improving overall user experience.
