# DynamoDB Global Tables

DynamoDB Global Tables enable you to have a fully managed, multi-region, and multi-active database that provides low-latency access to your DynamoDB tables. This feature allows for active-active replication, meaning applications can read from and write to the table in any region.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Region Access**: Access your DynamoDB tables with low latency, no matter where your users are located.
- **Active-Active Replication**: Perform reads and writes in any region. Changes are automatically replicated across all the regions.
- **DynamoDB Streams**: Utilization of DynamoDB Streams is a prerequisite for enabling Global Tables, facilitating the replication process.

## Use Cases

- **Global Applications**: Ideal for applications that require global access and low-latency reads/writes in multiple regions.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Enhances disaster recovery strategies by spreading data across multiple regions, reducing the impact of regional outages.
- **Real-Time Data Access**: Provides real-time data access to users around the world, improving user experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Enable DynamoDB Streams**: Before setting up Global Tables, ensure that DynamoDB Streams is enabled on your table.
2. **Create a Global Table**: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to add regions to your Global Table configuration.
3. **Configure Read/Write Capacity**: Optionally, configure read/write capacity settings for each region to optimize performance and cost.

By leveraging DynamoDB Global Tables, you can create highly available and globally distributed applications with minimal effort and maximum efficiency.
