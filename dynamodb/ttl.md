# DynamoDB Time To Live (TTL)

DynamoDB Time To Live (TTL) enables automatic deletion of items from a table once a specified expiry timestamp has been reached. This feature helps manage table storage efficiently by removing outdated items without manual intervention.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Deletion**: Items are automatically deleted after reaching the expiry timestamp, reducing the need for manual cleanup processes.
- **Configurable**: TTL settings can be configured at the item level, allowing for flexible expiration policies.
- **Cost-Efficient**: Helps in reducing storage costs by automatically removing unnecessary data.
- **No Performance Impact**: The deletion process is designed to have minimal impact on table performance.

## Use Cases

- **Data Retention Policies**: Automatically adhere to regulatory obligations by ensuring data is not stored beyond its required lifespan.
- **Session Management**: Manage web session data by automatically expiring session records after a certain period.
- **Temporary Data**: Automatically remove temporary data, such as cache or transient state information, after it is no longer needed.

## Getting Started

1. **Enable TTL**: Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to enable TTL on a DynamoDB table by specifying the attribute that will hold the expiry timestamp.
2. **Set Expiry Timestamps**: When adding or updating items, include the TTL attribute with a timestamp value indicating when the item should expire.
3. **Monitor Deletions**: Optionally, monitor the TTL deletions by enabling DynamoDB Streams on the table to capture delete events.

By utilizing DynamoDB TTL, you can automate the management of data lifecycle in your applications, ensuring that only relevant data is stored and reducing overall storage costs.
