# Lambda SnapStart

Lambda SnapStart significantly enhances the performance of your Lambda functions, offering up to a 10x improvement at no additional cost for functions running on Java 11 and above. This feature enables your function to be invoked from a pre-initialized state, eliminating the need for function initialization from scratch.

## How It Works

- **Pre-Initialization**: When SnapStart is enabled, AWS Lambda initializes your function ahead of time.
- **Snapshot Creation**: After initialization, Lambda takes a snapshot of the memory and disk state of the function.
- **Caching**: This snapshot is then cached, allowing for low-latency access when the function is invoked.

## Benefits

- **Performance Improvement**: By avoiding the initialization step for each invocation, functions start faster, significantly improving performance.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Enhanced performance at no extra cost, making it a cost-effective solution for optimizing Lambda functions.
- **Simplified Management**: Reduces the complexity of managing function initialization, providing a smoother operational experience.

When you publish a new version of your function, Lambda automatically repeats this process, ensuring that your function's performance remains optimized with each update.
